### Question 1

Consider the scenario:

A class `RoundedRectangle` has a hierarchy of super classes. Each of the super classes declares one or more instance variables. `RoundedRectangle` itself declares an instance variable itself called `radius`.

How does an object of type `RoundedRectangle` store ALL instance variables (declared up the hierarchy of super classes)
so that name resolution and value lookup will be fast?
